        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "Compiled languages are translated into machine code by a compiler before execution, making them faster (e.g., C, C++). Interpreted languages are executed line-by-line by an interpreter at runtime, making them easier to debug but generally slower (e.g., Python, JavaScript).\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2: What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "Exception handling in Python is a way to handle errors that occur during program execution. It allows the program to continue running instead of crashing. Python uses try, except, else, and finally blocks to catch and handle exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3: What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "The finally block in Python is used to execute code regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. It is typically used for cleanup actions like closing files or releasing resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4: What is logging in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "Logging in Python is the process of recording messages that describe events or errors during a program’s execution. It helps in debugging and monitoring the program. Python provides a built-in logging module for this purpose.\n",

        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "The __del__ method in Python is a destructor method. It is called automatically when an object is about to be deleted, and is typically used to clean up resources like closing files or releasing memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q6: What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "import loads the entire module, and you access functions or variables using the module name.\n",
        "\n",
        "but, from ... import loads specific functions or variables from a module, so you can use them directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q7: How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",

        "The basic steps in exception handling in Python are:\n",
        "\n",
        "Try – Place the code that might raise an exception inside a try block.\n",
        "\n",
        "Except – Handle the exception using one or more except blocks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Else (optional) – Execute code if no exception occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally (optional) – Execute cleanup code that runs no matter what.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q13: Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Q15: How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "Python's garbage collection system automatically manages memory by freeing up space taken by objects that are no longer in use. It uses reference counting to track the number of references to each object and a cyclic garbage collector to detect and clean up groups of objects with circular references.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q16: What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "The else block in exception handling is used to define code that should run only if no exception occurs in the try block. It helps separate normal code from error-handling code for better readability.\n",
